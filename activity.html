	<h2>Beach Play<h2>
<p>No vacation is complete without a beautiful beach on which to relax and find your bliss. 
Look for secluded beaches with warm waters, soft sand, and calm surf so you can swim and enjoy being enveloped in your very own natural salt water bath. 
While packing, don’t forget plenty of reading material and sunscreen, especially if you’ll be posting up on a remote beach without easy access to stores. 
You may also wish to read about the ocean animals and information in the climate you’ll be visiting. That way, the only surprises are good surprises!</p>

<h2>Stand Up Paddle Boarding</h2>
<p>This sport is popular for a reason and it makes for a fantastic vacation activity at LIAHONA luxury resort. 
When the waters on your beach are calm and warm, stand up paddle boarding can be just as relaxing as it is good for you. 
Get the blood flowing and warm up your muscles while taking in the scenery around you.</p>

 <h2>Night Snorkeling</h2>
<p>You’ll find snorkeling at many luxury resort destinations, but night snorkeling is an experience like no other. 
While night snorkeling, you’ll find nocturnal fish that aren’t visible during the day. Or you may experience fish that change as the sun goes down. 
For example, the Basket star hides during the day and fans out at night to catch plankton in their nets.
 Watch as the Basket stars catch their food and curl it into their mouths as you wade and swim in the beautiful warm shallow waters.</p>

 <h2>Biking</h2>
<p>Especially for active individuals and couples, biking is a great option for exploration and adventure in the luxury resort.
 Arrive quickly at some of the most scenic outlooks on the island via one of the many trails and roads. 
 Biking gives you a quick way to explore corners of your Caribbean island that other vacationers haven’t. 
At Secret Bay, you can go your own way on one of our mountain bikes.</p>

<p>Whether intended for exercise or just enjoying the gorgeous view of the place, kayaking is among the top activities to enjoy on your island getaway. 
Soak in the heat of the sun, explore the warm water around you, or work up a sweat while exploring the remarkable wild island around you. 
Along with paddle boarding, kayaking is a great way to access beaches, caves, and corners of the island that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to see. 
For the adventurous, this is the perfect vacation activity.</p>
